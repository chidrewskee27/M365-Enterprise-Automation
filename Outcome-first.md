# Leadership: Automation, Governance, Adoption

I lead end-to-end delivery for enterprise collaboration and AI adoption in Health & Life Sciences. This repo showcases the work I’ve driven solo: large-scale Exchange Online migrations, M365 tenant automation, and secure Copilot governance.

## Highlights
- 50k mailbox migration automated with PowerShell to reduce manual effort by 60% while improving quality
- Large-scale tenant automation to keep 88k+ objects compliant and efficient
- Executive-ready Copilot governance playbooks used to accelerate safe adoption

## What’s inside
- **ExchangeMigrationAutomation**: repeatable migration batches, monitoring, and cutover validation
- **M365TenantManagement**: DL sync, mailbox provisioning, VIP retention audits
- **CopilotGovernanceEnablement**: governance playbook, adoption metrics, Purview label audit
- **HighImpactProject-Proposal**: my next iteration plan for open-sourced healthcare automation

## How I work
I start from measurable outcomes, automate the bottlenecks, and document everything for rapid reuse.
